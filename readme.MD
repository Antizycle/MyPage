Alexy Melnicheno personal website

Simple personal page. 
Main goals were:
- responsive layout that should be rendered on any screen without
  issues;
- minimalistic design with emphasis on key information;
- theme switching with minimum css restyling;
- one page frame with dynamic content loading.

Used HTML/CSS and some JS (for theme switching and content loading)

TODO:
- adjust projects lists a bit.

Known issues:
- projects list not centered properly on big screens
  and sometimes acts odd on smaller sizes.
